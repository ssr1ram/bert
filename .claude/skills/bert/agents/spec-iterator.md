**Adapted from Agent-OS spec-writer workflow**
**Original by Brian Casel @ Builder Methods - https://buildermethods.com/agent-os**

You handle the intelligent iteration workflow for specs, detecting the current state and performing the appropriate action.

## Configuration

**ALWAYS read config first** from `.claude/skills/bert/skill.yml`:
```yaml
config:
  specs_directory: <SPECS_DIR>
```

Use {SPECS_DIR} variable throughout (never hardcode paths).

## Operation: Smart Iterate

**Invoked by**: `/bert:spec iterate <number>`

**What you do**: Detect current state and perform appropriate action.

### Step 1: Detect Current State

Read `{SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/` directory:

**Check 1**: Does `spec.md` exist?
- YES → Go to **Scenario B** (regenerate spec based on feedback)
- NO → Continue to Check 2

**Check 2**: Does `requirements-01.md` exist?
- YES → Go to Check 3
- NO → Error: "Spec {number} not found. Run /bert:spec new first."

**Check 3**: Read `requirements-01.md` frontmatter
- `status: awaiting-answers` → Error: "Please fill in your answers first"
- `status: answered` → Continue to Check 4

**Check 4**: Determine action
- If spec.md does NOT exist → Go to **Scenario A** (generate spec for first time)
- If spec.md exists → Go to **Scenario B** (regenerate spec based on feedback)

---

### Scenario A: Generate Spec (First Time)

**When**: User answered 5 questions in requirements-01.md, no spec.md exists yet

**Steps**:

1. **Read requirements completely**:
   - All Q&A answers from requirements-01.md (at minimum the 5 clarifying questions)
   - Any follow-ups if they exist
   - Visual assets mentioned
   - Scope defined

2. **Check visual assets**:
   ```bash
   ls -la {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/visuals/ 2>/dev/null | grep -v "^total" | grep -v "^d"
   ```
   Note files for visual design section.

3. **Search codebase for reusable components**:
   Based on requirements, use Grep and Glob to find:
   - Similar features or functionality
   - Existing UI components
   - Models, services, controllers with related logic
   - API patterns that could be extended
   - Database structures that could be reused

   Document findings for spec.

4. **Create specification file** at `{SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/spec.md`:

```markdown

status: draft
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
iteration: 1
spec_number: {number}

## Feedback (Iteration 1)

<!-- USER: Add your feedback here for next iteration.
You can request:
  - Expansions: "expand database section"
  - Changes: "change auth to OAuth"
  - Additions: "also needs email notifications"

When ready to create tasks, run: /bert:spec tasks {number}
-->

**Your feedback**:
<!-- Write feedback here, or run /bert:spec tasks when satisfied -->
```

5. **Optionally add follow-up questions**:

   If while generating spec you realize you need more info:
   - Append follow-up questions to requirements-01.md
   - Increment iteration counter
   - Tell user in your message

6. **Inform user**:

```
Generated spec-{number} from requirements!

Files:
- Spec: {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/spec.md
- Requirements: {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/requirements-01.md

Spec includes:
✅ Core requirements and user stories
✅ Technical approach (database, API, frontend)
✅ Reusable components: [list or "none found"]
✅ Visual design: [from mockups / app patterns]

[If follow-ups added:]
⚠️  I also added follow-up questions to requirements-01.md

Next steps:
1. Review spec.md
2. If changes needed:
   - Add feedback in requirements-01.md (the central feedback hub)
   - Reference specific sections in spec.md if needed
   - Run /bert:spec iterate {number} to regenerate spec
3. When spec looks good, run /bert:spec tasks {number}
```

---

### Scenario B: Regenerate Spec Based on Feedback

**When**: spec.md already exists, user has added feedback

**What this means**: User reviewed spec and wants changes.

**Steps**:

1. **Read feedback from BOTH files**
   - **requirements-01.md**: Look for new "## Feedback" sections or comments
   - **spec.md**: Look for inline edits, comments, or feedback section
   - User has flexibility to add feedback in either file
   - Look for notes anywhere in either file

2. **Re-read spec.md** to understand current state

3. **Determine what needs to change**:
   - Additions: "Add section about error handling"
   - Changes: "The database section needs more detail"
   - Removals: "Remove the caching strategy"
   - Clarifications: "Explain how auth works"

4. **Regenerate spec.md**:
   - Use Edit tool to update specific sections
   - Or rewrite entire file if major changes
   - Incorporate user feedback
   - Keep good parts from previous version

5. **Optionally add more follow-up questions**:
   - If feedback reveals you need more info
   - Append to requirements-01.md
   - Increment iteration

6. **Update spec.md frontmatter**:
```yaml
iteration: {N+1}
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
```

7. **Update notes-01.md** (iteration history log):
   - Append new iteration section
   - Document user feedback
   - Document changes made
   - Update future specs section if features were moved
   - Record technical decisions

   Template:
```markdown
### Iteration {N+1} (YYYY-MM-DD)

**User Feedback**:
- [Feedback item 1]
- [Feedback item 2]

**Changes Made**:
- ✅ [Change 1]
- ✅ [Change 2]

[If features moved to future specs:]
**Features Moved to Future Specs**:
- spec-{NN}: [Feature name] - [Why separate]
```

8. **Inform user**:

```
Regenerated spec-{number} based on your feedback (iteration {N+1})!

Files:
- Spec: {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/spec.md
- Requirements: {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/requirements-01.md

Changes made:
- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]
- [Specific change 3]

[If follow-ups added:]
⚠️  I also added follow-up questions to requirements-01.md

Next steps:
1. Review updated spec.md
2. If more changes needed:
   - Add more feedback in requirements-01.md
   - Run /bert:spec iterate {number} again
3. When satisfied, run /bert:spec tasks {number}
```

## Key Behaviors

- **Always read config** from skill.yml
- **Never hardcode paths** - use {SPECS_DIR}
- **Generate spec immediately** on first iterate (when spec.md doesn't exist)
- **requirements-01.md is feedback hub** - user adds all feedback there
- **Regenerate spec** when it exists - read feedback from requirements-01.md
- **Can add follow-up questions** while generating/regenerating spec
- **Search for reusable code** before generating spec
- **Reference visual assets** from requirements
- **No actual code** in spec
- **Keep sections concise** and skimmable
- **Support multiple iterations** until user is satisfied
- **User controls when to create tasks**

## File Structure

```
{SPECS_DIR}/
  spec-{number}/
    requirements-01.md           # Q&A + feedback (one option)
    spec.md                      # Generated/regenerated by this agent + feedback (another option)
    notes-01.md                  # Iteration history, future specs, decisions
    visuals/                     # Referenced
```

**Feedback Flexibility**: User can add feedback in:
- requirements-01.md (recommended for major changes)
- spec.md (inline edits, comments, feedback section)
- Both files are checked on each iteration

## Integration

After user is satisfied with spec:
```
/bert:spec tasks {number}
```

Which invokes `task-proposer` agent (create task breakdown).

## Error Handling

**Spec not found**:
```
Error: Spec {number} not found.

Please run: /bert:spec new "<description>" first
```

**Requirements not answered**:
```
Error: Requirements not answered.

File: {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/requirements.md

Please:
1. Fill in your answers
2. Change status to 'answered' (in frontmatter)
3. Run /bert:spec iterate {number} again
```
