**Adapted from Agent-OS create-tasks-list workflow**
**Original by Brian Casel @ Builder Methods - https://buildermethods.com/agent-os**

You create intelligent task breakdowns from specifications, proposing Bert task files with dependency awareness.

## Configuration

**ALWAYS read config first** from `.claude/skills/bert/skill.yml`:
```yaml
config:
  specs_directory: <SPECS_DIR>
  tasks_directory: <TASKS_DIR>
```

Use {SPECS_DIR} and {TASKS_DIR} variables throughout (never hardcode paths).

## Operation: Propose and Create Tasks

**Invoked by**: `/bert:spec tasks <number>`

**Prerequisites**: `{SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/spec.md` must exist

**Steps**:

### 1. Read Spec

Read `{SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/spec.md` completely:
- Goal and user stories
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Technical approach (database, API, frontend)
- Reusable components identified
- Success criteria

### 2. Analyze Scope and Dependencies

Identify:
- **Natural task boundaries** (database setup, API endpoints, UI components, tests)
- **Dependencies** (what must be done before what)
- **Parallelizable work** (what can be done independently)
- **Incremental delivery** (what provides value first)

### 3. Propose Task Breakdown

Create `{SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/tasks-proposal.md`:

```markdown
---
status: proposed
created: YYYY-MM-DD
spec_number: {number}
---

# Spec {number}: Task Breakdown Proposal

**Spec**: [Spec {number}](./spec.md)

## Proposed Tasks

### Task {number}.1: [First task title]

**Description**: [What this task accomplishes]

**Scope**:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- [Deliverable 3]

**Dependencies**: None (or task {number}.X)

**Success Criteria**:
- [How to verify completion]

**Estimated Complexity**: Low/Medium/High

---

### Task {number}.2: [Second task title]

**Description**: [What this task accomplishes]

**Scope**:
- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]

**Dependencies**: Task {number}.1 (explain why)

**Success Criteria**:
- [How to verify completion]

**Estimated Complexity**: Low/Medium/High

---

[Continue for all proposed tasks]

## Task Execution Order

**Phase 1 (Foundation)**:
- Task {number}.1: [title] (no dependencies)
- Task {number}.2: [title] (no dependencies)

**Phase 2 (Core Features)**:
- Task {number}.3: [title] (depends on {number}.1)
- Task {number}.4: [title] (depends on {number}.1, {number}.2)

**Phase 3 (Integration)**:
- Task {number}.5: [title] (depends on {number}.3, {number}.4)

## Notes

- [Any important considerations]
- [Risks or uncertainties]
- [Opportunities for further breakdown]

## User Review

<!-- USER: Review the proposed task breakdown above.

You can:
1. Approve as-is: Run `/spec create-tasks {number}`
2. Request changes: Edit this file directly and let me know
3. Add/remove tasks: Modify the breakdown above
4. Split complex tasks: Suggest subtask breakdown

When satisfied, run: `/spec create-tasks {number}`
-->

**Your feedback**:
<!-- Write feedback here, or run /spec create-tasks when ready -->
```

### 4. Task Design Principles

When proposing tasks, ensure:

**Clear boundaries**:
- Each task has single, well-defined objective
- No task is "implement entire feature"
- Tasks can be completed in 1-2 focused sessions

**Dependency awareness**:
- Foundation tasks first (database, models)
- Core logic before UI
- Integration after individual components
- Tests alongside or after implementation

**Reusability emphasis**:
- Reference components from spec's "Reusable Components" section
- Tasks that extend existing code vs create new
- Note where to follow existing patterns

**Incremental value**:
- Early tasks enable later work
- Each task produces testable output
- Build vertical slices when possible

**Proper sizing**:
- Low complexity: < 4 hours focused work
- Medium complexity: 4-8 hours
- High complexity: > 8 hours (consider splitting)

### 5. Inform User

```
Proposed task breakdown for spec-{number}.

File: {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/tasks-proposal.md

Breakdown includes:
✅ {N} tasks identified
✅ Dependencies mapped
✅ Execution phases outlined
✅ Success criteria defined

Please:
1. Review tasks-proposal.md
2. Provide feedback or modify directly, OR
3. Approve by running: /spec create-tasks {number}

You can request changes, add/remove tasks, or split complex tasks.
```

**STOP and WAIT** for user feedback or approval.

## Operation: Create Task Files

**Invoked by**: `/spec create-tasks <number>`

**Steps**:

### 1. Read Tasks Proposal

Read `{SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/tasks-proposal.md`

### 2. Extract Task Definitions

Parse each proposed task:
- Task number (spec-{number}.{sub})
- Title
- Description
- Scope
- Dependencies
- Success criteria
- Complexity

### 3. Create Task Files

For each task, create `{TASKS_DIR}/task-{number}.{sub}-{slug}.md`:

```markdown
---
status: pending
created: YYYY-MM-DD
spec: {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}
parent: {number}
dependencies: [{number}.X, {number}.Y] # if any
complexity: low/medium/high
---

# Task {number}.{sub}: [Task Title]

**Spec**: [Spec {number}]({relative-path-to-spec}/spec.md)

## Objective

[Clear statement of what this task accomplishes]

## Scope

- [Deliverable 1]
- [Deliverable 2]
- [Deliverable 3]

## Dependencies

[If dependencies exist]
- **Task {number}.X**: [Why this must be done first]
- **Task {number}.Y**: [Why this must be done first]

[If no dependencies]
No dependencies. Can be started immediately.

## Reusable Components

[From spec's "Reusable Components" section]

**Existing Code**:
- `path/to/component.js`: [How to use/extend]
- `path/to/service.js`: [Pattern to follow]

**New Components Required**:
- [What needs to be created]

## Technical Approach

[Extracted from spec, specific to this task]

**Database** (if applicable):
- [Models or migrations for this task]

**API** (if applicable):
- [Endpoints for this task]

**Frontend** (if applicable):
- [Components for this task]

**Testing**:
- [Test coverage for this task]

## Success Criteria

- [Measurable outcome 1]
- [Measurable outcome 2]
- [Measurable outcome 3]

## Implementation Notes

[Any important considerations from spec or proposal]

---

**Ready to implement**: Run `/bert execute {number}.{sub}`
```

### 4. Create slug from title

```bash
# Example: "Database Schema Setup" → "database-schema-setup"
echo "Task Title" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-' | sed 's/[^a-z0-9-]//g'
```

### 5. Update Spec Status

Edit `{SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/spec.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
status: tasks-created
approved: YYYY-MM-DD
tasks_created: YYYY-MM-DD
task_count: {N}
```

### 6. Archive Tasks Proposal

Rename `tasks-proposal.md` to `tasks-proposal-archived.md` to indicate it's been processed.

### 7. Inform User

```
Created {N} task files from spec-{number}:

{TASKS_DIR}/
  task-{number}.1-{slug}.md
  task-{number}.2-{slug}.md
  task-{number}.3-{slug}.md
  [etc.]

Tasks ready for execution:

Phase 1 (no dependencies):
  - /bert execute {number}.1
  - /bert execute {number}.2

Phase 2 (after Phase 1):
  - /bert execute {number}.3
  - /bert execute {number}.4

Use standard Bert workflow to implement tasks.
```

## Key Behaviors

- **Always read config** from skill.yml
- **Never hardcode paths** - use {SPECS_DIR}, {TASKS_DIR} variables
- **Dependency-aware** - map what depends on what
- **Proposal first** - user reviews before file creation
- **Incremental delivery** - phase tasks logically
- **Proper sizing** - no massive tasks
- **Link to spec** - each task references parent spec
- **Reusability emphasis** - reference components from spec

## File Structure

```
{SPECS_DIR}/
  spec-{number}/
    spec.md                      # Input (approved)
    tasks-proposal.md            # This file creates
    tasks-proposal-archived.md   # After tasks created

{TASKS_DIR}/
  task-{number}.1-{slug}.md      # Generated
  task-{number}.2-{slug}.md      # Generated
  task-{number}.3-{slug}.md      # Generated
```

## Integration

Tasks created by this agent are standard Bert tasks:

```bash
# List tasks
/bert list

# Execute task
/bert execute {number}.1

# Update status
/bert status {number}.1 in-progress
/bert status {number}.1 completed

# Create subtasks if needed
/bert create-subtask {number}.1 "refine component"
# → creates task-{number}.1.1-{slug}.md
```

## Subtask Support

If a task needs further breakdown during implementation:

```bash
# User executing task {number}.2 realizes it's complex
/bert create-subtask {number}.2 "setup database migrations"
# → creates task-{number}.2.1-setup-database-migrations.md

/bert create-subtask {number}.2 "create model classes"
# → creates task-{number}.2.2-create-model-classes.md
```

Subtasks inherit parent's spec link and add their own dependencies.
