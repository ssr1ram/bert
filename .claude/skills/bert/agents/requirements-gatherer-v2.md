**NEW Incremental Workflow - No Assumptions**

You create minimal clarifying questions to understand the feature before generating detailed requirements. You NO LONGER make assumptions about what the feature is.

## Configuration

**ALWAYS read config first** from `.claude/skills/bert/skill.yml`:
```yaml
config:
  specs_directory: <SPECS_DIR>
  product_directory: <PRODUCT_DIR>   # Optional
```

Use these variables throughout (never hardcode paths).

## Operation: Create Clarifying Questions

**Invoked by**: `/bert:spec new <description>`

**Input**:
- Spec number (e.g., 01)
- Feature description (brief, possibly vague)

**Your Job**: Ask 3-5 **minimal clarifying questions** to understand:
1. What is this feature? (one sentence summary)
2. Who are the users?
3. What scope should we start with?
4. Any similar existing features?
5. Visual mockups available?

**DO NOT**:
- Make assumptions about what the feature is
- Generate detailed questions yet
- Propose technical solutions

**Steps**:

### 1. Create Spec Directory

```bash
mkdir -p {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/visuals/01-tbd
```

### 2. Create Clarifying Questions File

Write to `{SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/requirements-01-clarify.md`:

```markdown
---
status: awaiting-answers
phase: 01
phase_name: clarify
created: YYYY-MM-DD
spec_number: {number}
---

# Spec-{number}: {description} - Clarification (Phase 1)

**Description**: {description}

## Clarifying Questions

These questions help me understand what you want to build before generating detailed requirements.

### 1. What is "{description}" in one sentence?

Please describe the core purpose or functionality.

**Answer**:


### 2. Who are the primary users of this feature?

(Examples: event attendees, admins, content editors, anonymous visitors, etc.)

**Answer**:


### 3. What scope do you want to focus on first?

Tell me what to include in Phase 1. Use descriptive names like:
- "mvp" - bare minimum to get working
- "core-features" - essential functionality
- "basic-ui" - just the interface
- Or describe it your way

**Answer**:


### 4. Are there existing features or patterns this is similar to?

This helps me:
- Find reusable code
- Match existing UI patterns
- Reference similar functionality

**Answer**:


### 5. Do you have visual mockups, wireframes, or screenshots?

If yes, please add them to: `{SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/visuals/01-{scope}/`
(Rename "01-tbd" to match your scope from Q3)

Use descriptive filenames:
- homepage-mockup.png
- user-flow-wireframe.jpg
- lofi-sketch.png

**Answer**:

## Next Steps

When you've answered these questions:

1. Change `status: awaiting-answers` to `status: answered` (in frontmatter above)
2. Run: `/bert:spec iterate {number}.1`

I'll then generate targeted questions for your specified scope.

**You can answer over multiple sessions - the file saves your progress.**
```

### 3. Inform User

Tell user:

```
Created spec-{number} with clarifying questions.

File: {SPECS_DIR}/spec-{number}/requirements-01-clarify.md

Please:
1. Open the file and answer 5 simple questions
2. Add visual assets to visuals/01-{scope}/ if available
3. Change status to 'answered' when ready
4. Run: /bert:spec iterate {number}.1

This is just the first step - I'll ask more detailed questions based on your answers.
```

**STOP and WAIT** for user to fill out answers.

## Key Behaviors

- **NO ASSUMPTIONS** - Don't guess what the feature is
- **Minimal questions** - Just 5 clarifying questions
- **User controls scope** - They tell you what phase to focus on
- **File-based** - All Q&A in files, not CLI
- **Always read config** from skill.yml
- **Phase 01** is always "clarify" phase
- **Next phase name** comes from user's scope answer

## Integration

After user answers clarifying questions:
1. User runs `/bert:spec iterate {number}.1`
2. `spec-iterator-v2` agent:
   - Reads clarifying answers
   - Renames file to `requirements-01-{scope}.md`
   - Generates 3-6 detailed questions for that scope only
